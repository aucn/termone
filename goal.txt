This term, in English, the children will be required to make an oral presentation in response to a familiar story. Consequently the children will need to choose a familiar book to talk about. To ensure that the children have equalaccess to these stories I be sending home a mini book, each week, for the children to revisit and reread with an adult. Please take the time to read these books with your child and encourage them to identify what they liked about the book, what their favourite part was and why. Also discuss with them the sequence of the story i.e. what happened at the beginning, the middle and the end of the story. At the end of the term the children will negotiate with me which book they would like to give a response to.
